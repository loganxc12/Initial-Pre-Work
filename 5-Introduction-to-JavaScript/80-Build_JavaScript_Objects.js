/*
OBJECTS are useful data structures similar to arrays, but instead of using indexes you
can access/manipulate data in objects using PROPERTIES that can be stored as strings,
numbers or even single words without quotes.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Mowgli",
  "legs": 8,
  "tails": 16,
  "friends": ["none"]
};
