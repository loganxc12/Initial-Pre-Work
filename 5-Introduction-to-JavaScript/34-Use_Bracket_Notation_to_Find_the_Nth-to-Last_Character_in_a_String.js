/*
You can use a string's length property to find the "nth-to-last" character as well
by subtracting a value greater than 1
*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
