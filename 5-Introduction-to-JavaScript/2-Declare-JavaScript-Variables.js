/*
Javascript provides 7 data types: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number,
and object.
Variables are names to represent the data we want to refer to (can store different
values at different times). We declare a variable with the keyword "var"; variable
names can't include spaces or start with a number.
*/

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
