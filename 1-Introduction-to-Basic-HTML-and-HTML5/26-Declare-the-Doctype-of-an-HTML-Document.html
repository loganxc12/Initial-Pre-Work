<!-- Some elements give overall structure to your page and should be included
in every HTML document. You can tell the browser which version of HTML your page
is using with the <!DOCTYPE hmtl> tag on the FIRST line (specifies HTML5, ! and
uppercase DOCTYPE are important, html is case insensitive). After setting DOCTYPE,
the rest of your HTML needs to be wrapped in html tags-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>My Minimalist Html Page</h1>
