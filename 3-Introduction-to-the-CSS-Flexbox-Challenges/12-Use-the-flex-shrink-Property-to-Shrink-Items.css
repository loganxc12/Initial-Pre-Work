/* In addition to properties that target the flex container, there are useful
properties for FLEX ITEMS including "flex shrink" - allows an item to shrink
if the flex-container is too small, takes numbers as values (the higher the
number, the more it will shrink compared to other items in the container...an
item with a flex-shrink value of 2 will shrink at twice the rate as an item with
a flex-shrink value of 1) */
